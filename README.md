Java Chatbot Documentation

**Introduction**
The Java Chatbot project aims to create a simple yet functional chatbot capable of engaging in conversations with users. The chatbot interprets user input and generates appropriate responses based on predefined rules. It provides a basic demonstration of how a chatbot can be implemented in Java for various scenarios.

**Implementation Details**
Programming Language: Java
IDE: Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA)
External Libraries: None
Runtime Environment: Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

**Interm Information**
Name : Aparna singh  Intern ID: COD5739

**Task Description **
the task assigned to Aparna singh during the codtech IT solutions Internship program is to write a java program the create a SampleChatbot.



**Usage Instructions**
Clone the Repository: Clone or download the repository containing the Java Chatbot project.
Open in IDE: Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Compile and Run: Compile the Main.java file and run the compiled bytecode.
Interact with the Chatbot: Follow the prompts to interact with the chatbot. Type your queries and press Enter to receive responses.
Exit: To exit the chatbot, type "exit" and press Enter.
**Code Explanation**
The Main class contains the main method that serves as the entry point for the chatbot application. It continuously prompts the user for input and generates responses based on predefined rules.

Main Class
Main Method: The entry point of the application. It initializes a Scanner object to read user input and processes queries using a series of if-else conditions.
Response Generation: Responses are generated based on predefined patterns and rules. Each if-else block corresponds to a specific type of query, such as greetings, inquiries, jokes, arithmetic operations, etc.
Error Handling: Exception handling is included for scenarios such as opening Notepad and general error handling.
